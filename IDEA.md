# Task Assist: Concept & Real-World Flow

Task Assist is a personal assistant that helps you break down work into manageable actions, track progress, and get reminders/notifications via Slack and calendar.

## How it Works

- User enters a work item they would like to accomplish & the tool breaks it down into manageable tasks using AI
- User reviews and approves the breakdown, sets tentative due dates and confirms
- User's work & task breakdown is stored and each work item is tracked to completion smartly
- User sees tasks added one at a time to their Google Calendar & can monitor progress
- Upon completion, user gets subsequent tasks from the work item added and tracked to completion
- Throughout, User receives progress updates & gets nudged/notified periodically through Slack
