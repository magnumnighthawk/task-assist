# Task Assist

Task Assist is an AI-powered workflow automation application designed to help you manage tasks and reminders with a multi-agent architecture. This project leverages Python, OpenAI, Langchain, Google Calendar API, and additional tools to provide a simple yet extensible solution for automating business workflows.

## Overview

Task Assist automates the process of breaking down high-level tasks, assigning them, verifying their completion, and scheduling reminders. The system is composed of four primary agents:

- **Task Generator Agent:** Uses NLP via OpenAI and Langchain to decompose tasks into actionable subtasks.
- **Execution Agent:** Manages the assignment and tracking of subtasks.
- **Verification Agent:** Confirms task completion through manual or automated checks.
- **Reminder Agent:** Integrates with Google Calendar to schedule task deadlines and reminders.

This modular design allows for a simple MVP that can be easily extended with more features in future iterations.

## Features

- **Task Decomposition:** Leverages OpenAI's API to break down complex tasks.
- **Task Assignment & Tracking:** Uses a simple execution module to manage task status.
- **Task Verification:** Provides a basic mechanism to confirm task completion.
- **Google Calendar Integration:** Schedules reminders and deadlines using the Google Calendar API.
- **User Interfaces:** Interact via terminal inputs or a simple UI built with Streamlit.
- **Local Development:** Designed to run on a MacBook using free-tier services and local resources.
- **Future Enhancements:** Plans to integrate vector databases (e.g., FAISS) for semantic search and enhanced data persistence.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables
  - `langchain-openai` for NLP and task decomposition
  - `langchain-community` for managing language model prompts and flows
  - `streamlit` for building a simple web-based UI
  - `google-api-python-client` and `google-auth` for Google Calendar integration
  - `faiss-cpu` (planned for future enhancements)
- **Optional Tools:**
  - Docker for containerization
  - SQLite or JSON files for local data persistence

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-assist.git
   cd task-assist
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and update the API keys and other configurations as needed.

2. **Google Calendar Integration:**
   - Follow Googleâ€™s documentation to set up OAuth credentials.
   - Save your OAuth token as `token.pickle` in the project root directory.

## Usage

### Terminal-Based Interface

Run the main script to interact with Task Assist through the terminal:

```bash
python execute_and_verify.py
```

### Streamlit UI

For a web-based interface, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Vector Database Integration:** Use FAISS for advanced semantic search and task similarity matching.
- **Improved UI/UX:** Enhance the dashboard and user interface for a better experience.
- **Asynchronous Task Management:** Implement Celery or a similar framework for improved scalability.
- **Automated Verification:** Develop rule-based or ML-driven methods for task verification.
